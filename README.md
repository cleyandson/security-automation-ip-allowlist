Portfolio project developed as part of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate">Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate</a>.

## 📝 Project Overview

This repository contains a Python project developed in a Jupyter Notebook that automates the maintenance of an IP address allow list. The script reads a text file of authorized IPs, removes specified addresses, and updates the file. This project simulates a common cybersecurity maintenance task designed to ensure that only trusted IPs have access to critical systems.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This project demonstrates proficiency in:
* **Python Scripting:** Using Python for security automation tasks within an interactive, cloud-based notebook environment.
* **File I/O Operations:** Reading from and writing to files using methods like `.read()` and `.write()`.
* **Data Manipulation:** Converting data types and filtering data based on specific criteria.
* **Applying Programming to Cybersecurity:** Solving a practical security challenge (access control list management) with code.
